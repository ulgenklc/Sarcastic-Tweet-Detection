# Sarcastic-Tweet-Detection
We use a Deep Learning framework to apply Natural Language Processing to automatically detect sarcasm and associated nuances from tweets.

The mergedSarcasm dataset contains comments and labels from multiple sources (1 = The Onion, 2 = Reddit, 3 = Twitter (the iSarcasm dataset))
